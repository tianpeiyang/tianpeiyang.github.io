This paper proposes a novel approach called Bayes-ToMoP which can efficiently detect the strategy of opponents using either stationary or higher-level reasoning strategies. Extensive simulations show that Bayes-ToMoP outperforms state-of-the-art opponent detection methods and therectical guarantees prove the optimality of Bayes-ToMoP.
