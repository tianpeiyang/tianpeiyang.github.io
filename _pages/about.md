Hello there, I am currently an Assistant Professor in [Reasoning and Learning Research Group](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/rl/) led by Yang Gao, at [School of Intelligence Science and Technology](https://is.nju.edu.cn/main.htm) at Nanjing University. Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Intelligent Robot Learning Lab](https://irll.ca/) at the University of Alberta, advised by [Matthew E. Taylor](https://drmatttaylor.net/) from 2021 to 2024. I received my Ph.D. in 2021 at Tianjin University, supervised by [Jianye Hao](http://www.icdai.org/jianye.html). My PhD thesis is titled ‘Efficient Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Based on Transfer Learning’.

My major research interests focus on AI Agents, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), and multiagent systems, especially in achieving efficient, generalized, and scalable RL and multiagent RL through transfer/multi-task learning, hierarchical learning, and opponent modeling. I am also interested in investigating efficient exploration in RL and multiagent RL. Currently, I am working on 1) how to effectively and efficiently build AI agents upon generative AI and RL techniques; 2) how to effectively transfer knowledge in cross-domain settings; 3) how to improve RL generalization and interpretability via symbolic planning/causal reasoning/program synthesis.  

I am currently serving as a reviewer for JMLR, TPAMI, TNNLS, TMLR, MACH, JMLC, IEEE TCDS, and IEEE/CAA, and a member of the (senior) program committee (NeurIPS, AAAI, ICLR, IJCAI, ICML, AAMAS, UAI, ICRA, CoRL, CIKM, ECAI, DAI).

`I am looking for PhD students starting in Fall 2026 or later (masters/research assistants starting in Fall 2025 or later), interested in (deep) reinforcement learning, multiagent learning, or AI Agents. If you are interested and have good programming skills and a reinforcement learning background, please email me your CV, transcripts, and future research proposal.`
