Hello there, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in College of Intelligence and Computing from Tianjin University. I received mt M.S. degree in software engineering from Tianjin University in 2017 and B.E. degree from School of Computer Software at Tianjin University in 2014. My research interests include artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems and deep reinforcement learning. My research focuses on norm emergence in MASs, transfer learning applied in multi-task RL and multiagent RL, and opponent modeling in MASs.
